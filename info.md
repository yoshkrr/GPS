# General Peace Status
.basic html code if you want your #general channel peace status for your discord server to be on a website
# hOw dO i dOwNlIaD?!?!?!?!?
.go to the "html.html" file and copy the code and paste it on an html website hosting service like "neocities" (the one I personally like)
.then edit the text and maybe even change the style of it (if you know how to code though)
.no credit needed as this is very easy to make with html i made this for fun
